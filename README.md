- âš¡ Fun fact:
- By a twist of fate, I ended up majoring in Japanese during my undergraduate studies and achieved the N1 level in Japanese proficiency.
- While studying a foreign language, I also minored in philosophy and mathematical modeling, which sparked my interest in computers.
- Although I did not have any mathematics courses in my undergraduate program, I completed many open courses from UC Berkeley and MIT.
- I thoroughly worked on the projects and assignments, so my foundation in mathematics and physics is quite solid.

## My Projects
- [IoT5506](https://github.com/SeiKasahara/IoT5506):This is an out-of-the-box open-source IoT platform specifically designed for Firebeetle and Xiao ESP32S3. The platform utilizes Docker for CI/CD automated builds, uses Sqlite3 as the default database management system, and provides Nginx port forwarding settings.
- [Web Crawler](https://github.com/SeiKasahara/FinancialCrawler): It uses LSTM to analyse the emotional data from much many investors(maybe millions of comments), with a logistics regression drived web crawler
- [Machine Learning Foundation](https://github.com/SeiKasahara/MachineLearningEx) Implemented linear regression, logistic regression, and a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using basic NumPy (this project is very classic).
- [Penni](https://github.com/codersforcauses/penni): Collaborate project with third-party, use ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Typescript-33AAAA?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=FFFFFF) + ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB) + ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-FFFFFF?style=flat&logo=django&logoColor=61DAFB) to build web application
