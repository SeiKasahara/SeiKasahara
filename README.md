- âš¡ Fun fact:
- By a twist of fate, I ended up majoring in Japanese during my undergraduate studies and achieved the N1 level in Japanese proficiency.
- While studying a foreign language, I also minored in philosophy and mathematical modeling, which sparked my interest in computers.
- Although I did not have any mathematics courses in my undergraduate program, I completed many open courses from UC Berkeley and MIT.
- I thoroughly worked on the projects and assignments, so my foundation in mathematics and physics is quite solid.

## My Projects
- [Web Crawler](https://github.com/SeiKasahara/FinancialCrawler): It uses LSTM to analyse the emotional data from much many investors(maybe millions of comments), with a logistics regression drived web crawler
- [Machine Learning Foundation](https://github.com/SeiKasahara/MachineLearningEx) Implemented linear regression, logistic regression, and a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using basic NumPy (this project is very classic).
